MiniJava Compiler Guide
========================

Scope
======
Extensions:

For loops:
- Implemented basic for loop (with optional initialization, optional loop test, optional update, and body).
- Block statements in the initialization or update code may cause parsing errors.
-- This is due to my parser implementation where semicolons are accepted at the end of some statements.
-- I implemented a temporary workaround for the semicolon parsing issue due to time constraints.


AST Changes
===========
- Added class-specific identification tables.
- Added type comparison in the various TypeDenoter subclasses.
- Declarations contain runtime information (through an attached RuntimeEntity).
- Expressions contain type information (through an attached TypeDenoter).
- Added ForStmt (subclass of Statement) for the for-loop extension.
- Identifiers are attached to their corresponding declarations.
- References are attached to their corresponding declarations.
- Added NullLiteral (subclass of Terminal).
- Terminals contain an int 'kind' rather than a TokenKind due to Token implementation.

Tests
======
The compiler meets all the requirements from PA1-PA4 and passes all tests from the PA4 test suite.
Below are the supplied tests for each extension (descriptions are in the test files themselves):

For loops:
fail501.java
fail502.java
pass501.java
pass502.java
