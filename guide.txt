MiniJava Compiler Guide
========================

Scope
======
[Scope of your project. Please make clear any optional parts of the project you have
implemented, if any. List known limitations of your implementation (it is better for you
to identify these than for me to find them).]


AST Changes
===========
[Summary of changes to AST classes. Summarize the changes you made to the
AbstractSyntaxTree classes that were distributed. Describe changes, if any, made to
the AST class structure as well as additions made to the classes to support contextual
analysis and code generation.]


Tests
======
[A description of tests (if tests are supplied). This should describe any tests in the Tests
directory (see below). If you are not able to run PA4Test.java you should include
some test(s) that exercise the portion of the compiler that is working. If you have
completed optional extensions of the project, you should include some comprehensive
tests for each extension. You can follow the passxxx, failxxx convention we have
been using for tests that should demonstrate correct behavior from your compiler and
those that should be rejected by your compiler.]
